# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

ALL OF THEM

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 5.0.x   | :x:                |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 4.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Just tell me doman it.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.


You'll only know about the vulnerability when I tell you. It will not be fixed, you'll just have to live with it.
